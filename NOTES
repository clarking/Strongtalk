This fork is a personal project, it's intended to build only in linux,
and it's not intended for everyday use.



 Arch (nov 22) with GCC 12.2.0.

Changes done for this branch so far:

- Modified Cmake build to be simpler and only build natively on linux
- Added some castings and minor modifications for GCC 12.2
- Formated all source files in Clion
- Added libreadline as a build requirement in CmakeFile
- Removed Nasm from build as the only dependency was detected unused by CLion
- Reordered folders to resemble the original folder structure and simplify build
- Disabled test suite for now as the cmake file was modified
- Commented many SPDLOG messages as newer version dropped ptr support
